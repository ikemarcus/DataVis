            There are many versions of this horrifying story. The Muffin Man, also known as the Drury Lane Dicer, was the first known serial killer in England. His name was Frederic Thomas Lynwood, and he was born in 1563 and died in 1612. There are many accounts of Lynwood’s crimes, however, no surviving records. This is either one hell of a folklore story or one of history’s most creepy mysteries.
            it was common for families to have fresh foods delivered to their homes. Every morning, families could expect to find a parcel of bread for that day’s meals. A popular morning meal was muffins, but these were more like English muffin bread and less sugary sweet American muffins.
            The Muffin Man would make his deliveries just like other bakers, but he would lure children away from their homes by playfully tying a string it a muffin and pulling it away from the steps where the parcel lay. The kids, likely thinking this was a fun game, would chase the muffins, which led to The Muffin Man’s bakery, where he would kill the children. But not before torturing them.
            The Muffin Man did not appreciate the fierce competition in his surrounding neighbourhoods. So he murdered seven other bakers, or so the tales go.
            The Muffin Man seemed to have taken pleasure in taunting and torturing children before he killed them. According to lore, he used wooden spoons to knock children out. However, experts doubt that a wooden spoon would be enough to render a person unconscious. Still, the stories persist.
            Between the years 1589 and 1598, Lynwood murdered 15 children. His shop was a popular spot for kids to visit, where they would run and cause havoc. Supposedly, Lynwood wanted them to stay away from his shop, so he devised a vicious plan. He lured children intentionally to his shop by pulling a muffin on a string. Once inside, he would knock them out and then kill them.
            Children came up with a catchy sing-song rhyme to sing that supposedly was a way to warn other children to stay away from Lynwood’s bakery and to be wary of those around them. It goes like this: </h2>
            <h2>Oh, do you know the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>The muffin man, the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>Oh, do you know the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>That lives on Drury Lane?</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>Oh, yes, I know the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>The muffin man, the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>Oh yes, I know the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>That lives on Drury Lane</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>Oh, now we know the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>The muffin man, the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>Oh now we know the muffin man</h2>
            <h2>That lives on Drury Lane</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>No one knows if this story is true. It has been told (and retold) so many times that the story’s true origins are forever lost.</h2>

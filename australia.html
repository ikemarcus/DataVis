            This is an urban legend. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of the most recognisable structures in the world – but few know about the sinister cloud it has hanging over it.
            Construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge first began in 1924. It was such a long and dangerous endeavour that sixteen ironworkers lost their lives in the eight years it took to finish the job. These deaths are officially recorded in the history books, but some say that another three workers lost their lives. But these deaths were mysteriously hushed.
            The story goes that three unlucky contractors fell into the huge pylons during construction. Retrieving the bodies was deemed too difficult and costly, given they were under enormous pressure to complete the project. Rather than delay production they decided to leave the bodies entombed within the pylons, where they allegedly remain today.
            These construction workers were drifters with no permanent roots in the area, which is how their disappearances were able to go unnoticed. If this urban myth is true, Sydney’s bold national icon is actually a giant burial site.
            Today, tourists often report strange happenings on or near the iconic bridge. Some say they’ve heard awful screams or unusual knocking sounds, hysterical laughter and even dramatic shifts in temperature. Some motorists even say they’ve seen ghostly apparitions appear in the middle of the road while crossing the bridge. They slam on their breaks only to discover there was nothing there at all.
            Could these spirits be linked to the unofficial burial site that is allegedly deep within the pylons of Sydney Harbour Bridge? Credit: Daily Telegraph

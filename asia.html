            Junko Furuta, the murder case of the "concrete-encased high school girl murder case" 40 days of hell.
            This was a Japanese teenage girl (only 17 years old). Who was kidnapped on November 25, 1988, and was raped, tortured and murdered on January 4th 1989. In total 40 days. ( some other sources say that it was 44 ) The final attack took around two entire hours. She succumbed to her wounds, and died that day, in pain and alone. 
            The four murderers stuffed her body in a drum filled with concrete and dumped her at a construction site. After the police found the drum, her body was so mutilated that the only way she was recognised was by her fingerprints. 
            This murder is considered one of the worst crimes ever committed in human history.
